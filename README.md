# Sam Erickson's Neovim Configuration

This configuration uses [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim). I switched to using lazy so that I spend a bit less time tweaking my editor, and when things break the community will fix them, so I always have a functional editor and I only need to maintain a few personal plugins and options.
